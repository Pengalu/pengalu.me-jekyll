Song of the day:  00. ~OUT ON THE STREET~ by Adolf Nomura

Today we tested our hypothesis by presenting with other groups. Our goal was to hold 2-4 filled coffee cups, using the crosshatching to make it more stable. Among almost every group I personally talked to, we were told that the grid-styled legs may
not be stable enough to even hold the weight. They could crumble immediately undeer the weight. Also, if placed in the center, the mugs might be too far from the legs to hold up the surface properly. We also received feedback that the design may
be less interesting if it's not visible through the surface of the tabletop, which originally had a flat surface to distribute the weight evenly. 

We gave some feedback- most notably to Anika and Jacob regarding how they might have to consider strengthening the interior to prevent collapse and also the # of pillars used being changed to reflect the artistic intent often seen in Grecco-Roman works.
Their project is of similar size to ours, so we'll likely face similar challegnes.

Friday last week was spent CADing. I'd categorize that as the plan phase. I've been doing work on the leg part of the table design while Owen coaches me through sketching. On Tuesday, we ended up adding line width to the lines on the leg and extruding it to our desired
height- around 16 inches if I recall correctly. It's a basic grid-like pattern with the inner lines given width for the extrusion. About 4x4 inches in size if I remember correctly, with 2 lines travelling through both vertically and horizontally. 

Overall, the CAD work is coming along well. Akash is doing the main surface of the table, and it's coming together nicely. We opted NOT to CAD the more natural features plastered onto the inspiration piece and instead do that fully manually. It'd just
be a pain to CAD and not really worth it since we can't realistically be that precise with cardboard. We're hoping the natural curves and such associated with Jürgen Mayer's design will help bring the table enough stability to hold... something?
What exactly that might be is undecided to some extent.

Didn't get to journal yesterday but the content in this update stretches back to 9-13-23.

Yesterday we entered our research phase by coming up with a list of designers and architects whose styles we could use to develop our piece. I was a big fan of Ronald Knol's work, mainly because it could be achieved using our primitive materials. A.G. Fronzoni had some
beautiful graphical designs but his furniture works were less striking. Kendrick Kellogg was another interesting choice, and the idea of using his High Desert House work as inspiration for a tabletop shelf / storage rack was interesting, but ultimately we decided
against it, even though it was close. Other suggestions included Zaha Hadid- whose style we didn't all agree on- and Frank Lloyd Wright- the creator of Falling Waters.

Ultimately, it was the work of Jürgen Mayer- and his firm J. MAYER H. that beat the other contestants. We determined the final architect via a Pugh chart. We drew most of our thoughts on Jürgen Mayer from his work in Seville, Spain- the Metropol Parasol. It acts as a covering 
for a parking garage and plaza, but we realized that you could very easily integrate a similar cross-hatched, natural design into a table. Our Pugh chart rated all the contestants based on 4 criteria: 
Viability, Style, Strength, and Cad-ability. 
Mayer placed highly in viability for construction, style, and strength especially because basing the design of the furniture piece off of an actual canopy-like structure would make it easy to have a mostly clear space below it. Unfortunately, Cad-ability was low- the cross hatching
was a concern, but we decided it'd be worth a shot after Mayer's work beat the closest other designer- Frank Lloyd Wright- in most categories.

### Prompt Question: What part of the Engineering Design Process do you believe will be hardest for you? Why? Conversely, what step will be easiest and why?
I honestly can't decide whether the creating or planning phase will be the hardest. Working with random scrap cardboard will be challenging, especially with the natural flow and cross-hatching in the designs we're inspired by. On the other hand, we definitely had an easy time researching and defining design criteria- can it hold weight, does it look cool, can we make it. Ask / Research was pretty light on our end.
