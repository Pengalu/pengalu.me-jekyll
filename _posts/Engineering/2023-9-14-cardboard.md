# Cardboard Engineering

## 9-14-23
Didn't get to journal yesterday but the content in this update stretches back to 9-13-23.

Yesterday we entered our research phase by coming up with a list of designers and architects whose styles we could use to develop our piece. I was a big fan of Ronald Knol's work, mainly because it could be achieved using our primitive materials. A.G. Fronzoni had some
beautiful graphical designs but his furniture works were less striking. Kendrick Kellogg was another interesting choice, and the idea of using his High Desert House work as inspiration for a tabletop shelf / storage rack was interesting, but ultimately we decided
against it, even though it was close. Other suggestions included Zaha Hadid- whose style we didn't all agree on- and Frank Lloyd Wright- the creator of Falling Waters.
