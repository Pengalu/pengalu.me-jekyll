# God I love Cinestill
Cinestill produces some fucking sick film stocks. I know it's stereotypical for the average young buck photographer who got into film for the "aesthetic" to fall in love with 800T but
I genuinely love how inconsistent and strange it can be in comparison to other film stocks. It can be chaotic to shoot on, and I'd have it no other way. 

So why write an article on 400D at 1 AM instead of on 800T? Firstly, you can actually shoot it during the day- when things actually happen around here- secondly... I actually have no clue but look at these kickass pictures lmfao- none of these have been edited in any way since being scanned (except cropping), I'll be saving that for when I eventually post these somewhere less scuffed.
